# Website Engine Optimizations and Bugfixes

This update fixes the critical issue where new WordPress sites were showing the Apache default page instead of WordPress content, due to Apache VirtualHost configurations not being properly enabled.

## Key Fixes

1. **Fixed Apache symlink creation**: Ensured that when Apache VirtualHost configurations are created in `/etc/apache2/sites-available/`, they are properly enabled by creating necessary symlinks in `/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/`.

2. **Added robust failover mechanisms**: If `a2ensite` fails to create the symlink, the script now attempts to create it manually.

3. **Added configuration status display**: Added debugging output to show the status of Apache configurations for easier troubleshooting.

4. **Enhanced error handling**: Made the site creation process more resilient to common Apache configuration issues.

## How to Test

Create a new website using the optimized script:

```bash
./create-site.sh testsite
```

The site should now be properly configured with Apache and display the WordPress installation rather than Apache's default page.

## Technical Details

The issue was occurring because the Apache configuration files were correctly created in `sites-available/` but they weren't being properly enabled (symlinked) in `sites-enabled/`. This caused Apache to use its default virtual host configuration instead of the custom one for the new WordPress site.
